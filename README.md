# Multimedia Library Search

Search your local video and photo library by face. Point it at a directory, index it, and find every clip or photo a person appears in — entirely offline, no cloud.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) available on `PATH`
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU + CUDA for faster indexing

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd multimedia-library-search

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **GPU users:** replace `onnxruntime` with `onnxruntime-gpu` in `requirements.txt` before running `pip install`.

## Workflow

```
index → (auto-cluster) → label → search → compile / collage
```

1. `python cli.py index /path/to/media` — extract faces from videos and photos; incremental cluster runs automatically
2. Open `/label` — assign names to person clusters; merge duplicates; re-cluster if needed
3. Open `/search` — search by name or upload a reference photo to find appearances across videos and photos
4. Use the **Highlight Reel** panel to compile video clips into a downloadable MP4, or the **Photo Collage** panel to generate a JPEG grid of photo appearances

For the first run with no existing clusters, the auto-triggered incremental pass falls back to a full cluster automatically.

## CLI Reference

### Index a media directory

```bash
python cli.py index /path/to/media
```

Scans for both videos (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`) and photos (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.heic`, `.heif`, `.webp`). Already-indexed files are skipped automatically.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--interval 2.0` | `1.0` | Seconds between sampled keyframes (videos only). Higher = faster, lower accuracy. |
| `--gpu` | off | Use CUDA for face inference (requires `onnxruntime-gpu`). |
| `--no-cluster` | off | Skip the automatic incremental cluster pass after indexing. |
| `--eps 0.6` | `0.6` | DBSCAN eps used by the auto-triggered incremental cluster. |

After indexing, stale media (deleted from disk since the last run) is pruned automatically, then an incremental cluster pass runs so new faces appear in `/label` without a separate step. Pass `--no-cluster` when batch-indexing several directories before a single cluster run.

### Cluster faces into person identities

```bash
python cli.py cluster              # full DBSCAN — initial setup or restructure
python cli.py cluster --incremental  # assign new faces only, preserve labels
```

**Full cluster** groups all faces from scratch using DBSCAN. Use this on first run or to tune `eps` and restructure everything. **All existing labels are lost.**

**Incremental cluster** assigns only unlabeled (new) faces to existing persons using centroid distance, then runs a mini-DBSCAN on the remainder to discover new persons. Existing labels are fully preserved.

After every cluster run, redundant face thumbnails are trimmed automatically — keeping only the representative samples shown in the label UI (at most 5 per person).

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--incremental` | off | Run incremental mode instead of full DBSCAN. |
| `--eps 0.6` | `0.6` | Grouping radius (euclidean distance on L2-normed embeddings). Lower = tighter clusters. |
| `--min-samples 3` | `3` | Minimum faces required to form a cluster. |

### Maintenance commands

```bash
python cli.py prune                   # remove stale data for media deleted from disk
python cli.py prune --dry-run         # preview what would be removed

python cli.py trim-thumbnails         # delete redundant face thumbnails (keeps label-page samples)
python cli.py trim-thumbnails --dry-run

python cli.py backfill-dates          # populate recorded_at for already-indexed videos
python cli.py stats                   # video/photo count, face count, labeled/unlabeled persons
```

`prune` and `trim-thumbnails` run automatically as part of `index` and `cluster` respectively; these manual commands are for one-off use or verification with `--dry-run`.

`backfill-dates` is a one-time migration for videos indexed before recording-date extraction was added. For each video it tries, in order: ffprobe container tag → filename date pattern → file mtime.

### Start the web UI

```bash
python cli.py serve
```

Opens at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Options: `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.

## Web UI

| Page | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Index | `/` | Start indexing, watch live progress, see all indexed videos and photos |
| Label | `/label` | Assign names to person clusters; merge duplicates; trigger re-clustering |
| Search | `/search` | Search by name or reference photo; play results in-browser; compile highlight reels and collages |

### Label page

- **Cluster Unlabeled Faces** — incremental pass; labels preserved, safe to run any time
- **Full Re-cluster** — restructures from scratch; existing labels are erased
- Both controls accept `eps` and `min-samples` with inline tooltips
- Select two cards and click **Merge Selected** to combine duplicate clusters

### Search page

**Search by name** — type a labeled person's name (autocomplete from existing labels). Results are split into a **Videos** tab and a **Photos** tab; the tab showing more results is active by default.

**Search by photo** — upload any image containing a face. Results are ranked by match confidence (closest embedding distance first) across both videos and photos.

**Videos tab** — results grouped by unique video, sorted by most appearances first. Each card shows three evenly-sampled scene frames, a scene count, and scene chips. The tab count reflects unique videos, not individual face detections.

**Photos tab** — photo results shown as a scrollable grid. Click any card to open it in a full-screen lightbox with keyboard navigation (`←` / `→` to browse, `Esc` to close).

**Scene chips** — each chip represents one detected scene. A brief isolated appearance shows as a single timestamp (`1:23`); a continuous stretch shows as a range (`0:00–5:52`). Clicking any chip opens the video at that moment.

**Video player** — custom player with:
- Timestamp markers on the scrubber (yellow lines at every detected appearance)
- Hover a marker to see the time; click to jump to it
- `Space` — play / pause
- `←` / `→` — seek ±5 seconds
- `Esc` — close
- Fullscreen button

### Highlight Reel

Appears when named persons have video results. Compiles all appearances into a single downloadable MP4 using FFmpeg.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Clip length (sec) | 30 | Duration of each snippet, centered on the detected scene midpoint. |
| Scene gap (sec) | 30 | Detections within this many seconds are treated as one scene → one clip. |
| Max clips per video | 5 | Cap on scenes taken from a single video, so one long video doesn't dominate. |
| Clip order | Earliest first | Order clips by recording date ascending, descending, or randomly. |

Recording date comes from the ffprobe container tag, filename date pattern, or file mtime — in that priority order. Run `python cli.py backfill-dates` to populate dates for already-indexed videos.

### Photo Collage

Appears when named persons have photo results. Compiles matching photos into a downloadable JPEG using a masonry grid layout.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Columns | 3 | Number of columns in the grid. |
| Sort order | Earliest first | Sort photos by capture date ascending, descending, or randomly. |
| Date captions | on | Overlay the capture date on each photo cell. |

Capture date is read from EXIF `DateTimeOriginal`, falling back to file mtime.

## Data

All indexed data lives in `data/` and `static/thumbnails/`. Delete those directories to start over.
